WIP Lerna + Yarn Workspaces monorepo of various UI components and NPM modules.

Just getting going, so far we have...

1. [mock-data](https://github.com/unleashit/npm-library/tree/master/packages/mockData) - Typescript wrapper for [mock-data-generator](https://github.com/danibram/mocker-data-generator) to easily generate random data from a selection of templates or full custom schemas. Returns a JS object and/or a file in JSON format.
2. [React pagination](https://github.com/unleashit/npm-library) - coming soon
3. [React login component](https://github.com/unleashit/npm-library) - coming soon
4. [React sign-up/registration component](https://github.com/unleashit/npm-library) - coming soon
5. [React Help Desk](https://github.com/unleashit/npm-library) - coming soon

A [demo app](https://github.com/unleashit/npm-library/tree/master/packages/demos) is available for previewing the components.
